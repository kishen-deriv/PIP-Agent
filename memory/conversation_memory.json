The purpose of this plan is to provide you with clear guidance and support to help you succeed in your role.\n\nWe have identified several key areas where your performance has fallen short of expectations:\n\nPerformance Areas Requiring Improvement:\n\n1. Progress on Assigned Tasks and Timely Communication\n\nCurrent performance:\nRegular progress updates were not consistently provided on assigned projects until specifically requested, which has impacted the team's ability to track project status and make timely decisions.\n\nExamples:\nThroughout Q4, no regular progress updates were provided on the visual automation tool evaluation until specifically requested. On November 12, 2024, during a catch-up call, concerns were raised about the lack of progress, and instructions were given to create a clear comparison sheet documenting the tools tested. An example comparison sheet was provided for reference, and the need for consistent progress updates every Thursday or Friday was emphasized. By November 15, 2024, the comparison sheet remained incomplete, prompting a reminder via Slack reiterating the requirement for consistent updates by the end of each Thursday, which was acknowledged.\n\nExpected performance:\n\nAs a AI Engineer for the AI team, you were expected to evaluate and finalize the visual automation tool by the end of Q4, proactively communicate with vendors and team members to ensure milestones are met, address technical challenges, and provide regular, concise, and accurate progress updates without being prompted.\n\n2. Proactiveness in Addressing Issues\n\nCurrent performance:\nTechnical issues that affected regression testing were not proactively addressed, resulting in delays that impacted release timelines.\n\nExamples:\nA significant number of automation tests failed in the regression tests for tags V20241112_0, V20241216_0, and V20241204_0, and no proactive action was taken to address these issues. On November 11th and 12th, 2024, concerns were raised in Slack about the recurring flaky automation failures causing delays in the regression process. A request was made for a concrete plan to address and resolve these issues, which was acknowledged with a promise to work on improving the reliability of the tests moving forward. The timeline for accomplishing a concrete plan on resolving recurring flaky automation failures was 1 month, which was not met.\n\nExpected performance:\n\nAs a AI Engineer for the AI team, you were expected to ensure the Cypress automation for regression runs smoothly without flaky failures that could cause delays and lead to missing the release cutoff time. As the team lead, you were also expected to assist the team in investigating and resolving issues when they encounter a high volume of failures.\n\n\n\nNext steps on expected improvements:\n\nProgress on Assigned Tasks and Timely Communication\n\nGoal: Finalize the vendor evaluation and share the decision by 17 Jan 2025.\n\nAction Plans:\nSet reminder and provide weekly updates on research and migration progress in #project_automated_testing starting immediately after vendor finalization.\nCreate a dashboard to track the weekly migration progress with the new tool.\nReview PRs on new tool migration and provide constructive feedback aligned with documented best practices.\nDocument best practices and create a guideline for using the new tool by 24 Jan 2025.\nDevelop and share a migration plan from Cypress Percy to the new low-code tool by 31 Jan 2025.\nBegin weekly Zoom knowledge-sharing sessions on the new tool for all QA team members starting after vendor finalization, ensuring at least five recorded sessions by end of March 2025.\nAddress and resolve team members' questions about the new tool in the #need_help_<new_tool_name> channel starting two weeks after tool finalization.\nSubmit the 2x2 QA monthly report for January 2025 detailing progress, challenges, and mitigating actions.\n\nProactiveness in Addressing Issues\n\nGoal: Ensure that no release cut-off times are missed due to automation issues within 1 month.\n\nAction Plans:\nDevelop a detailed strategy plan to address and reduce automation test failures, and share the completed regression strategy document by January 31, 2025.\nMonitor every regression channel daily and actively participate in discussions related to automation issues and solutions.\nDevelop a guideline on outline the to-do step when seeing a Cypress failure in regression by 24 Jan 2025.\nMonitor every regression channel daily and actively participate in discussions related to automation issues and solutions.\nEnsure that no effort is spent on updating the Cypress test if the code update requires more than 5 minutes of work.\n\nTo support your improvement efforts, we will provide:\n\n- Biweekly mentorship and check-ins with Umithra and Mee Yun to review Indulekha's initial progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement.\n- Consultation with Mark O'Donnell for advice on technical problems and recommendations for appropriate approaches.\n\nWe will monitor your performance for the next 90 days and conduct fortnightly reviews, involving your reporting manager and HRBP to assess your progress and provide feedback.\n\nIt is crucial that you demonstrate consistent improvement and meet the outlined objectives by the end of the PIP period. Should you fail to improve your work performance to an acceptable level, the company may, at its sole discretion, have no option but to terminate your employment contract.\n\nWe are confident in your ability to make the necessary improvements and are committed to supporting your success. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or additional support during this process.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nSarah\nManager\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nI, Marvin Chin, I.D./I.C./Passport No.: [identification number] hereby confirm receipt of a copy of this Performance Improvement Plan and agree to comply with its contents.\n\n\n\n\n_______________ \n\nDate:"

The purpose of this plan is to provide you with clear guidance and support to help you succeed in your role.\n\nWe have identified several key areas where your performance has fallen short of expectations:\n\nPerformance Areas Requiring Improvement:\n\n1. Progress on Assigned Tasks and Timely Communication\n\nCurrent performance:\nRegular progress updates were not consistently provided until specifically requested. This lack of proactive communication made it difficult to assess project status and delayed decision-making processes.\n\nExamples:\nOn November 12, 2024, during a catch-up call, concerns were raised about the lack of progress on the visual automation tool evaluation. Instructions were given to create a comparison sheet documenting tools tested with must-have features, and an example sheet was provided for reference. The importance of consistent progress updates every Thursday or Friday was emphasized. By November 15, 2024, the comparison sheet remained incomplete, prompting a reminder via Slack reiterating the need for consistent weekly updates on the evaluation progress.\n\nExpected performance\n\nAs a AI Engineer for the AI department team, you were expected to evaluate and finalize the visual automation tool by the end of Q4, proactively communicate with vendors and team members to ensure milestones are met, address technical challenges as they arise, and provide regular, concise, and accurate progress updates throughout the evaluation process.\n\n2. Proactiveness in Addressing Issues\nCurrent performance:\nWhen automation tests failed in regression tests for multiple tags (V20241112_0, V20241216_0, and V20241204_0), proactive action was not taken to address these issues, resulting in regression testing delays that impacted release timelines.\n\nExamples:\nOn November 11th and 12th, 2024, concerns were raised in Slack regarding recurring flaky automation failures causing delays in the regression process. A request was made for a concrete plan to address and resolve these issues. The request was acknowledged with a promise to improve test reliability moving forward. However, the agreed timeline of one month for delivering a concrete plan to resolve recurring flaky automation failures was not met.\n\nExpected performance\n\nAs a AI Engineer for the AI department team, you were expected to ensure Cypress automation for regression runs smoothly without flaky failures that could cause delays and lead to missing release cutoff times. As team lead, you were also expected to assist the team in investigating and resolving issues when they encounter a high volume of failures.\n\n\n\nNext steps on expected improvements:\n\nProgress on Assigned Tasks and Timely Communication\n\nGoal: Finalize the vendor evaluation and share the decision by 17 Jan 2025. Achieve 100% of visual automation in Trader's Hub smoke test by 28 Feb 2025.\n\nAction Plans:\nSet reminder and provide weekly updates on research and migration progress in #project_automated_testing starting immediately after vendor finalization.\nCreate a dashboard to track the weekly migration progress with the new tool.\nReview PRs on new tool migration and provide constructive feedback aligned with documented best practices.\nDocument best practices and create a guideline for using the new tool by 24 Jan 2025.\nDevelop and share a migration plan from Cypress Percy to the new low-code tool by 31 Jan 2025.\nBegin weekly Zoom knowledge-sharing sessions on the new tool for all QA team members starting after vendor finalization, ensuring at least five recorded sessions by end of March 2025.\nAddress and resolve team members' questions about the new tool in the #need_help_<new_tool_name> channel starting two weeks after tool finalization.\nSubmit the 2x2 QA monthly report for January 2025 detailing progress, challenges, and mitigating actions.\n\nProactiveness in Addressing Issues\n\nGoal: Ensure no release cut-off times are missed due to automation issues within 1 month.\n\nAction Plans:\nDevelop a guideline on outline the to-do step when seeing a Cypress failure in regression by 24 Jan 2025.\nMonitor every regression channel daily and actively participate in discussions related to automation issues and solutions.\nEnsure that no effort is spent on updating the Cypress test if the code update requires more than 5 minutes of work.\n\nTo support your improvement efforts, we will provide:\n\n- Biweekly mentorship and check-ins with Umithra and Mee Yun to review progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement.\n- Consultation opportunities with Mark O'Donnell for advice on technical problems and recommendations for appropriate approaches.\n\nWe will monitor your performance for the next 90 days and conduct fortnightly reviews, involving your reporting manager and HRBP to assess your progress and provide feedback.\n\nIt is crucial that you demonstrate consistent improvement and meet the outlined objectives by the end of the PIP period. Should you fail to improve your work performance to an acceptable level, the company may, at its sole discretion, have no option but to terminate your employment contract.\n\nWe are confident in your ability to make the necessary improvements and are committed to supporting your success. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or additional support during this process.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nSarah\nManager, AI Department\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nI, Marvin Chin, I.D./I.C./Passport No.: [identification number] hereby confirm receipt of a copy of this Performance Improvement Plan and agree to comply with its contents.\n\n\n\n\n_______________ \n\nDate:"

This has impacted project timelines and team decision-making processes.\n\n**Examples:**  \nThroughout Q4, there were no regular progress updates provided until specifically requested. This lack of initiative in communicating progress made it difficult to assess the status of the project and delayed decision-making.\n\nOn November 12, 2024, during our catch-up call, I raised concerns about the lack of progress on the visual automation tool evaluation. I instructed you to create a clear comparison sheet documenting the tools tested, including a list of must-have features. I provided an example of a comparison sheet for reference.

Develop a detailed strategy plan to address and reduce automation test failures, and share the completed regression strategy document by January 31, 2025.\n2. Monitor every regression channel daily and actively participate in discussions related to automation issues and solutions.\n3. Identify and prioritize the most common flaky tests, and implement fixes to stabilize them within the next 30 days.\n4. Develop a guideline outlining the to-do steps when seeing a Cypress failure in regression by 24 Jan 2025.\n5. Ensure that no effort is spent on updating the Cypress test if the code update requires more than 5 minutes of work.\n\n## SUPPORT RESOURCES\n\n* Biweekly feedback sessions from Mee Yun to review Indulekha's initial progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement.\n* Job shadowing with Reshma on production issue handling in #announce_bugs_usability_issues channel.\n\nI am committed to supporting you through this improvement process.

You were asked to build a solution diagram, define the scope, and maintain cards correctly so that they reflect the statement of work, but these expectations were not fully met.\n\n**Expected performance:**\nYou are expected to take ownership of technically challenging work in the team, critically analyze problems and approaches, perform investigations, and implement solutions.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT PLAN:**\n\n**Performance Gap 1: Ownership and motivation to build the complete solution for MT5-event-streaming plugin**\n\n**Goal:** Create a complete solution for capturing events from MT5 servers and confirm they are accurately persisted and read for subsequent processing. This solution shall be confirmed by the DevOps team, arranged for gradual deployment into production, and tested for stability and performance. All necessary steps are to be documented as Miro diagrams, and ClickUp cards for estimating and iterating. This goal should be completed within 2 months.\n\n**Action Plans:**\n1. Work with stakeholders (Seva, Daniel) on the architectural design, build diagrams, define scope as ClickUp cards, and provide estimations.\n2. Take ownership of the deployment of the MT5-event-streaming-plugin.\n3. Arrange the deployment process with the WinOps/DevOps team (Basel, Andreas).\n4. Provide a rollout strategy and execute it.\n\n**SUPPORT AND RESOURCES:**\n* Support from colleagues including Seva and Basel\n* Necessary guidance and resources for achieving the goals\n* Weekly feedback from the manager and requested technical staff\n\nWe believe you have the ability to make these improvements and meet the expectations of your role as an AI Engineer. This plan is designed to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities and commitment.\n\nThis Performance Improvement Plan will be in effect for 2 months from the date of this document. We will meet regularly to review your progress and provide feedback. At the end of this period, we will evaluate whether you have successfully met the goals outlined in this plan.\n\nPlease sign below to acknowledge receipt and understanding of this Performance Improvement Plan.\n\nEmployee Signature: ______________________ [Employee Name]    Date: ______________\n\nManager Signature: ______________________ [MANAGER NAME]     Date: ______________"

You have been asked to build a solution diagram, define the scope, and maintain cards correctly, so that they reflect the statement of work.\n\nExpected performance:\nThe expected performance is to take ownership of the technically challenging work in the team, be able to critically analyze problems and approaches, perform investigations, and implement solutions.\n\nNext steps on expected improvements:\n\nOwnership and motivation to build the complete solution for MT5-event-streaming plugin\n\nGoal: Create a complete solution for capturing events from MT5 servers and confirm they are accurately persisted and read for subsequent processing. It shall be confirmed by the DevOps team, arranged for gradual deployment into production, and tested for stability and performance. All necessary steps are to be documented as Miro diagrams, and ClickUp cards for estimating and iterating.\n\nAction Plans:\n1. Work with stakeholders (Seva, Daniel) on the architectural design, build diagrams, define scope as Clickup cards, and provide estimations.\n2. Take ownership of the deployment of the MT5-event-streaming-plugin, arrange the process with the WinOps/DevOps team (Basel, Andreas), provide the rollout strategy, and execute it.\n\nTo support your improvement efforts, we will provide:\n- Support from colleagues, like Seva and Basel\n- Necessary guidance and resources for achieving the goals\n- Weekly feedback from the manager and requested technical staff\n\nWe will monitor your performance for the next 2 months and conduct reviews to assess your progress and provide feedback.\n\nIt is crucial that you demonstrate consistent improvement and meet the outlined objectives by the end of the PIP period. Should you fail to improve your work performance to an acceptable level, the company may, at its sole discretion, have no option but to terminate your employment contract.\n\nWe are confident in your ability to make the necessary improvements and are committed to supporting your success. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or additional support during this process.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n[MANAGER NAME]\nManager\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nI, [Employee Name], I.D./I.C./Passport No.: [identification number] hereby confirm receipt of a copy of this Performance Improvement Plan and agree to comply with its contents.\n\n\n_______________ \nDate:"

I sent a reminder via Slack, reiterating to provide consistent updates on the evaluation progress by the end of each Thursday. You acknowledged this and agreed to give consistent updates on the evaluation progress.\n\nExpected performance:\nThe expected performance is to evaluate and finalize the visual automation tool by the end of Q4. During the evaluation, you are expected to proactively communicate with vendors and team members to ensure milestones are met. As a team lead, you must address technical challenges and provide regular, concise, and accurate progress updates. By the end of Q4, you should have completed the evaluation and selected a visual automation tool based on the outcome.\n\n2. Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions\n\nCurrent performance:\nOn November 11, 2024, during the incident #incident_twillio-tajikistan-issue-11-nov-2024, you did not participate in the incident channel, despite being part of the Squad User Profile Management. This lack of involvement led to other team members having to step in and assist, delaying the resolution process.\n\nExamples:\nOn November 11, 2024, during the incident #incident_twillio-tajikistan-issue-11-nov-2024, you did not participate in the incident channel, despite being part of the Squad User Profile Management. This lack of involvement led to other team members having to step in and assist, delaying the resolution process.\n\nExpected performance:\nThe expected performance is to actively participate in all squad discussions related to production issues and contribute effectively to QA problem resolution during incidents. You are expected to take ownership of QA tasks, ensuring that production fixes are investigated, scenarios are prioritized for automation where possible, and issues are resolved with the highest urgency to meet release deadlines.\n\nNext steps on expected improvements:\n\n1. Lack of Progress and Proactive Action on the Visual Automation Tool Evaluation\n\nGoal: Finalize the vendor evaluation and share the decision by 17 Jan 2025.\nAchieve 100% of visual automation in Trader's Hub smoke test by 28 Feb 2025\n\nAction Plans:\n1. Set reminder and provide weekly updates on research and migration progress in #project_automated_testing starting immediately after vendor finalization.\n2. Create a dashboard to track the weekly migration progress with the new tool.\n3. Review PRs on new tool migration and provide constructive feedback aligned with documented best practices.\n4. Document best practices and create a guideline for using the new tool by 24 Jan 2025.\n5. Develop and share a migration plan from Cypress Percy to the new low-code tool by 31 Jan 2025.\n6. Begin weekly Zoom knowledge-sharing sessions on the new tool for all QA team members starting after vendor finalization, ensuring at least five recorded sessions by end of March 2025.\n7. Address and resolve team members' questions about the new tool in the #need_help_<new_tool_name> channel starting two weeks after tool finalization.\n8. Submit the 2x2 QA monthly report for January 2025 detailing progress, challenges, and mitigating actions.\n\n2. Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions\n\nGoal: The goal for improvement is to take full ownership of QA P2P-related tasks during production incidents, providing progress updates within 24 hours of each incident. Additionally, submit a detailed monthly report that reviews squad production issues and highlights your contributions to QA resolutions. You are also expected to manage all squad P2P-related manual and automation tasks, ensuring no task remains unattended for more than 2 days. These goals should be achieved within the next 90 days.\n\nAction Plans:\n1. Follow up on the bug mentioned in this Slack thread (<https://deriv-group.slack.com/archives/C0124FT6URM/p1735289297468999>) and ensure it is resolved by January 10th.\n2. Set a timer to monitor updates in the \"Announce\" bug and the P2P channel.\n3. Create a monthly production issue report.\n\nTo support your improvement efforts, we will provide:\n\nFor Visual Automation Tool Evaluation:\n- Biweekly mentorship and check-ins with Umithra and Mee Yun to review your initial progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement.\n- Consult with Mark O'Donnell for advice on technical problems and recommendations for appropriate approaches.\n\nFor Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions:\n- Biweekly feedback sessions from Mee Yun to review your initial progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement.\n- Job shadowing with Reshma on production issue handling in #announce_bugs_usability_issues channel\n\nWe will monitor your performance for the next 3 months and conduct regular reviews to assess your progress and provide feedback.\n\nIt is crucial that you demonstrate consistent improvement and meet the outlined objectives by the end of the PIP period. Should you fail to improve your work performance to an acceptable level, the company may, at its sole discretion, have no option but to terminate your employment contract.\n\nWe are confident in your ability to make the necessary improvements and are committed to supporting your success. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or additional support during this process.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[MANAGER NAME]\nManager\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nI, [Employee Name], I.D./I.C./Passport No.: [identification number] hereby confirm receipt of a copy of this Performance Improvement Plan and agree to comply with its contents.\n\n_______________ \nDate:"
