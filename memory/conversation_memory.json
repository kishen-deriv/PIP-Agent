        "content": "Thank you for providing the support resources for each performance gap. Let me analyze this information:\n\nThe support resources you've provided are generally well-defined, but I have a few observations:\n\n1. There appears to be some inconsistency in names. In the support resources, you mention \"Indulekha\" while the PIP is for \"Marvin Chin\". This might need clarification to ensure the resources are correctly aligned with the employee in question.\n\n2. The support resources for the first two performance gaps are identical. While this may be appropriate if the same type of support applies to both areas, it's worth considering if there are any specific resources that might be more tailored to each distinct performance gap.\n\n3. For \"Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions,\" you've included job shadowing with Reshma, which is a good specific resource for that particular gap.\n\nWould you like to refine any of the support resources before we generate the final PIP document?"

        "content": "# PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN\n\n**Date:** [Current Date]\n\n**Employee:** Marvin Chin  \n**Position:** AI Engineer  \n**Department:** AI  \n**Manager:** Sarah\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) has been developed to address specific performance concerns and provide a structured approach to help Marvin Chin succeed in his role as an AI Engineer. The plan will be in effect for 3 months, during which progress will be regularly monitored and evaluated.\n\n## PERFORMANCE AREAS REQUIRING IMPROVEMENT\n\n### 1. Lack of Progress and Proactive Action on the Visual Automation Tool Evaluation\n\n**Current Performance:**  \nThroughout Q4, there were no regular progress updates provided until specifically requested. This lack of initiative in communicating progress made it difficult to assess the status of the project and delayed decision-making.\n\n**Specific Examples:**  \nOn November 12, 2024, during a catch-up call, concerns were raised about the lack of progress on the visual automation tool evaluation. Instructions were given to create a comparison sheet documenting the tools tested with must-have features. By November 15, 2024, the comparison sheet was still not completed, requiring a reminder via Slack.\n\n**Expected Performance:**  \nThe expected performance is to evaluate and finalize the visual automation tool by the end of Q4. During the evaluation, proactively communicate with vendors and team members to ensure milestones are met. As a team lead, address technical challenges and provide regular, concise, and accurate progress updates. By the end of Q4, complete the evaluation and select a visual automation tool based on the outcome.\n\n### 2. Lack of Proactiveness in Handling Cypress Maintenance and Regression Delays\n\n**Current Performance:**  \nA significant number of automation tests failed in the regression tests for tags V20241112_0, V20241216_0, and V20241204_0 without proactive action to address these issues, resulting in delayed regression testing and impacted release timelines.\n\n**Specific Examples:**  \nOn November 11th and 12th, 2024, concerns were raised in Slack about recurring flaky automation failures, which were causing delays in the regression process. A concrete plan to address and resolve these issues was requested with a 1-month timeline, which was not met.\n\n**Expected Performance:**  \nThe expected performance is to ensure the Cypress automation for regression runs smoothly without flaky failures that could cause delays and lead to missing release cutoff times. As the team lead, assist the team in investigating and resolving issues when they encounter a high volume of failures.\n\n### 3. Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions\n\n**Current Performance:**  \nInsufficient participation in squad-related production issue discussions, particularly during critical incidents.\n\n**Specific Examples:**  \nOn November 11, 2024, during the incident #incident_twillio-tajikistan-issue-11-nov-2024, there was no participation in the incident channel, despite being part of the Squad User Profile Management. This lack of involvement led to other team members having to step in and assist, delaying the resolution process.\n\n**Expected Performance:**  \nThe expected performance is to actively participate in all squad discussions related to production issues and contribute effectively to QA problem resolution during incidents. Take ownership of QA tasks, ensuring that production fixes are investigated, scenarios are prioritized for automation where possible, and issues are resolved with the highest urgency to meet release deadlines.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT GOALS AND ACTION PLANS\n\n### 1. Lack of Progress and Proactive Action on the Visual Automation Tool Evaluation\n\n**Goal:**  \nFinalize the vendor evaluation and share the decision by January 17, 2025. Achieve 100% of visual automation in Trader's Hub smoke test by February 28, 2025.\n\n**Timeline:** 3 months\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- Set reminder and provide weekly updates on research and migration progress in #project_automated_testing starting immediately after vendor finalization\n- Create a dashboard to track the weekly migration progress with the new tool\n- Review PRs on new tool migration and provide constructive feedback aligned with documented best practices\n- Document best practices and create a guideline for using the new tool by January 24, 2025\n- Develop and share a migration plan from Cypress Percy to the new low-code tool by January 31, 2025\n- Begin weekly Zoom knowledge-sharing sessions on the new tool for all QA team members starting after vendor finalization, ensuring at least five recorded sessions by end of March 2025\n- Address and resolve team members' questions about the new tool in the #need_help_<new_tool_name> channel starting two weeks after tool finalization\n- Submit the 2x2 QA monthly report for January 2025 detailing progress, challenges, and mitigating actions\n\n### 2. Lack of Proactiveness in Handling Cypress Maintenance and Regression Delays\n\n**Goal:**  \nEnsure that no release cut-off times are missed due to automation issues during this period. This includes preventing production bugs caused by skipping automation failures and, consequently, missing manual testing.\n\n**Timeline:** 1 month\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- Develop a guideline outlining the to-do steps when seeing a Cypress failure in regression by January 24, 2025\n- Monitor every regression channel daily and actively participate in discussions related to automation issues and solutions\n- Ensure that no effort is spent on updating the Cypress test if the code update requires more than 5 minutes of work\n\n### 3. Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions\n\n**Goal:**  \nTake full ownership of QA P2P-related tasks during production incidents, providing progress updates within 24 hours of each incident. Additionally, submit a detailed monthly report that reviews squad production issues and highlights contributions to QA resolutions. Manage all squad P2P-related manual and automation tasks, ensuring no task remains unattended for more than 2 days.\n\n**Timeline:** 3 months\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- Follow up on the bug mentioned in the Slack thread (https://deriv-group.slack.com/archives/C0124FT6URM/p1735289297468999) and ensure it is resolved by January 10th\n- Set a timer to monitor updates in the \"Announce\" bug and the P2P channel\n- Create a monthly production issue report\n\n## SUPPORT RESOURCES AND TOOLS\n\n### For \"Lack of Progress and Proactive Action on the Visual Automation Tool Evaluation\":\n- Biweekly mentorship and check-ins with Umithra and Mee Yun to review progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement\n- Consultation with Mark O'Donnell for advice on technical problems and recommendations for appropriate approaches\n\n### For \"Lack of Proactiveness in Handling Cypress Maintenance and Regression Delays\":\n- Biweekly mentorship and check-ins with Umithra and Mee Yun to review progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement\n- Consultation with Mark O'Donnell for advice on technical problems and recommendations for appropriate approaches\n\n### For \"Lack of Engagement in Squad-Related Production Issue Discussions\":\n- Biweekly feedback sessions from Mee Yun to review progress, provide constructive feedback, and offer guidance for improvement\n- Job shadowing with Reshma on production issue handling in #announce_bugs_usability_issues channel\n\n## MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROCESS\n\nProgress will be monitored through:\n- Biweekly check-in meetings with Sarah to review progress on each improvement goal\n- Daily monitoring of Slack channels and project updates\n- Review of weekly update submissions and adherence to timelines\n- Monthly evaluation of overall performance improvement\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThis Performance Improvement Plan will be in effect for the next 3 months. Successful completion of the PIP requires meeting all improvement goals and consistently demonstrating the expected performance in each identified area. \n\nFailure to achieve the expected improvements within the specified timeline may result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nWe are committed to providing the necessary support to help you succeed in this improvement process. Please feel free to discuss any questions or concerns regarding this plan with your manager, Sarah.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Employee Acknowledgment:**\n\nI have read and understand the terms of this Performance Improvement Plan.
